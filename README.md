# Intro

This is a portfolio page to show off some of the first projects I have created so far throughout the course I am currently studying. For this page specifically, I was able to fool around with some more advanced CSS properties, and used flex/@media properties to have it remain readable while adjusting the size. I hope to add many more projects to this page as I go!

## Navbar/Main banner section

The navbar brings you down to various parts of the portfolio page. The background image is connected to the about-me section, which lets you scroll down while keeping the image looking nice through out (this was done by keeping the background attachment fixed for the specific class). Next to my name at the top includes a little profile picture of myself. I hope to update it when I grow my hair back!

##  Projects section

![Projects](/assets/images/projects.png)

The projects portion of the page shows previews of the other websites that have been created through the course so far, and takes the user to each one when they click on it. The color filter stops being greyed out on each one once you hover over it (done using greyscale filter with hover attribute on css classes). Each project also grows a little bit when hovered over as well.

## Contact Me section and footer

Shows the contact info, each portion of the div centered with rounded borders. The footer is directly below, which doesn't really say anything except for the fact it was made with ❤️
